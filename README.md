# Mental Health Alerts for K-12: Reverse Engineering GoGuardian Beacon
## Problem
There is a need for mental health resources in K-12 education but school staff are often overwhelmed with cases. In this project, we reverse engineer an application called GoGuardian Beacon that notifies designated faculty and guardians about online activity that indicates risk of harm to self or others. We decided to implement the model that GoGuardian uses for classification. The model determines whether a student is at risk of harming themselves or others through classification (supervised learning)
